# Uncomment the above lines to force HTTPS
# Make sure your server supports mod_rewrite and that it is enabled
# This will redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS
# Ensure you have a valid SSL certificate installed
# and that your server is configured to handle HTTPS requests.
# If you encounter issues, check your server's error logs for more details.
# If you are using a shared hosting environment, you may need to contact your hosting provider for assistance.
# Remember to test your site after making changes to ensure everything works as expected.
# If you are using a CMS or framework, ensure that it is compatible with the changes made
# and that any necessary configurations are updated accordingly.
# Always backup your .htaccess file before making changes to avoid any potential issues.
# If you are using a content management system (CMS) like WordPress, Joomla, or Drupal,
# ensure that the CMS's settings are also configured to use HTTPS if you enable the rewrite
# rules for HTTPS redirection.
